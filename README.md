# GPT Editor
by John Vahedi

Will call GPT to edit your documents and merge those edits as native suggestions. 

This implementation is only _Proof of Concept_ at this time. Has limitations and not a fully polished product. 

## Getting started

You can download the `"EditorBot"` **zip file** to get a portably executable version of this tool; full instructions inside. 

Additional general functions and visualizations are **available** through the **Jupyter** notebook. 

ðŸŽ‰ Have fun!
