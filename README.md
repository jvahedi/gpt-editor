# GPT Editor
by John Vahedi

Will call GPT to edit your documents and merge those edits as native suggestions. 

This implementation is only _Proof of Concept_ at this time. Has limitations and not a fully polished product. 

## Getting started

You can download the "EditorBot" **zip file** to get a portably executable version of this tool. 

Additionally, more general functions and visualizations are availble through the jupyter notebook. 


Have fun!
